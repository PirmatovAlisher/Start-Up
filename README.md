I took a free web site template and wrote backend for it.

This web site has features like :

1. Admin area with its controllers
2. User area with its controllers
3. Dynamic Authorization is implemented 
4. User information edit page
5. Forget/ Reset password with Email integration
6. And much more...


And as I mentioned above, Dynamic Authorization is implemented, you can get closer explanation in one of my other project.
